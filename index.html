        <p>Attracting customers is a win for any business. Engaging, developing and retaining existing customer is a MUCH BIGGER win.</p>
        <p>Here are many reasons others state as to why customers churn, not enough value, poor quality communications, no brand loyalty, bad customer service, changing customer expectations, improvement of policies and guarantees, business feels outdated, etc...</p>

        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>We are semi-retired business strategy and technology executives with over 30 years experience in building start-ups, growing corporations, and advising entrepreneurs and business minds on how to achieve business success (and happiness).</p>
        <p>We fervently believe in the power of phenomenal customer service, an underserved aspect of business that when done correctly delivers more brand, sales and marketing value than one can fathom…and pretty much benefits all facets of a business if done correctly.</p>
        <p>Early in our careers, we followed the traditional model of managing our cost per acquisition, pushing products and services down a channel, and not intimately developing relationships with customers…relationships that not only turned the business around, but made them wildly successful.</p>
        <p>Some of the companies we’ve been involved with have reached tremendous achievements, rankings as some of the fastest growing companies in America, industry leading Net Promoter Scores, unparalleled sales growth, rankings on Inc, Forbes and more, and even delivering internal benefits.</p>
